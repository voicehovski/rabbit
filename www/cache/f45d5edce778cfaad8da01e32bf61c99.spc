</div>
<p>Also, we worked hard to improve PHP 7 compatibility, exchanged volatile loops and conditions for more robust code and added more error handling code to prevent breaking javascripts. New abstract language helper functions now create the SQL for the language fallbacks, thus reducing bugs and increasing consistent behaviour. The backend now provides more functions for a comfortable workflow, more tooltips, filters, stored states of filters, fixed links and small GUI enhancements. Editing an order now calculates proper results. For example, changing the order status for one item now updates the inventory correctly.</p>
<p>The whole 'Tools' section got cleaned up and a more logical layout. We added a new wizard for setting the safepath, which sets a secure safepath with one click. The old function to change the storeowner got enhanced and now works reliable even when the vmuser entry is missing.<br />The revenue report now works correctly to the second. There is also a new hidden config to set the mode for the week.</p>
<p>The new joomla core 3.7.4 creates the plugin object while updating, so updating a VirtueMart plugin ends in a fatal error because the VM plugins need the loaded VirtueMart environment. Therefore we added a small system plugin, which ensures that the vm environment is loaded.</p>
<p>New triggers increase the flexibility of VirtueMart. The triggers plgVmBeforeStoreProduct and plgVmAfterStoreProduct in the product model allows automatically set product properties. The triggers plgVmOnUpdateCart (in cart controller) and plgVmOnAddToCart (in cart helper function add) give programmers more control when a user is adding an item to the cart.</p>
<p>The cart also has been enhanced with new features. We now have the intuitive automatic shipment/payment. The old method was to set a shipment/payment automatically, when there was only one choice. Then we added a small javascript, which sets the configured method automatically, when available. This had the disadvantage that only one method could be automatically configured and when it was not available, nothing happened. The new method automatically sets the first method. The item update within the cart now also uses ajax, except for removing a product, because there was no backward compatible solution (we may find one later). The new cart layout does not show an extra 'Save' button for the shipment/payment selection anylonger. Plugins which provide extra data must add the button themself.</p>
<p>Opening the order details now works also with ajax. Ajax for the category browse view currently is too complex considering backward compatibility, but it is of course planned for the future. The new productdetails layout now uses the thumbnail function to display the main image. This sounds a bit strange at first, but at the end it makes the automatic resizing feature also available for the main images. Layout overriders can now also change the used layout for the order list and order detail views per hidden config.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new&nbsp; VirtueMart 3.2.2 is mainly a bugfix release with very few new features. In VirtueMart 3.2.x the backend language behaviour changed. Previously VM always took the shop language for displaying the content in the VM administration views, regardless the selected backend language. Since VM 3.2 it uses the selected backend language. That created some confusion especially with language fallbacks, because managers had no indication whether or not they saw a language fallback. Now country flags are added to display the origin of the language string, when a language fallback is displayed. Some additional language options are now available. The shop language can now be set directly in the VirtueMart configuration. The language issue of the registration emails is fixed. Also we found a fix for the width of the chosen dropdowns.<br />Other minor features and bug fixes address quick-and-dirty written plugins, outdated relations and adjustments for joomla 3.7.0.</p></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"milbo@gmx.de (Max Milbers)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Latest News";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 May 2017 17:09:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:31:"

<p>The new handling of the category view and categories is the most interesting feature of the new core. The new options for categories are set globally in the VM configuration and can be finetuned in the category itself and/or in the menu item of the category. The new category view has all old options of the "frontpage" view, so shopowners can now also display grouped products of the category for example featured or topten. The old frontpage view "virtuemart" is now deprecated and won't be developed further, but it will still work for updaters. Additional GUI enhancements in the backend reduce clicks and provide a better overview of the store. Ajax loaded categories and javascript outsourced into libraries do increase the performance when browsing the administration area.</p>

<h3>Improvements under the hood</h3>
<p>The new core got a lot improvements under the hood. The design of the system became more consistent and more and more follows the object caching strategy. This means that we prefer to load a full object, even we just need the name, because it is quite likely that we need the full object a bit later anyway. Also we added program caches for whole functions, not just database searches. Furthermore the new core sets course to Wordpress compatibility. For example the options per category are important for WP, because there are no menu item options similar to the ones used in joomla. The new language system indeed still uses the joomla JLanguage object, but the handling above got separated, so we can better use it in WP. It also has the advantage, that we can load different languages with language overrides for each language correctly in one page call. We need this for example for different email languages. Previously we just reused the old JLanguage object. The system works a bit more performant (not measurable in time, but load) and has less overhead.</p>
<h3>Update friendly</h3>
<p>We paid a lot attention to updaters. Updated systems are set into the legacy layout mode by default. In case a shop uses a system plugin working with VirtueMart, it may happen that there are problems with a multilanguage shop. In this case ask the plugin developer for an updated version (most 3rd party developers already provide an updated version). For layout changes, we highly recommend to use the new layout options.</p>
<p>Templaters and any 3rd party developer using the VirtueMart config object in the trigger onAfterInitialise, please read here http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=136826.msg478498#msg478498</p>

<p>Joomla 2.5.x is not anylonger supported by the Joomla project, but we know that a lot people still use joomla 2.5. with VirtueMart. As promised, we provide a fix <a href="http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/1036/Joomla2.5.28-20161214PATCH.zip">http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/1036/Joomla2.5.28-20161214PATCH.zip</a>&nbsp;(Direct link).</p>
<p>This patch is just the one for j2.5.28 of last year extended by the new files. Update your joomal 2.5.x at least to the last version j2.5.28.</p>
<p>It is normal that an unpatched j2.5.28 logs you out.

There won't be any new vm3.0.x updates other than if we have a security issue. Some of our developers are still developing on Joomla 2.5 to ensure the backward compatibility. But from now on, any new version will be developed on the most recent Joomla or WordPress releases. We won't break the compatibility by purpose, but we just cannot test any longer for older versions.</p>
<p>We have got VirtueMart running on WordPress already in our laboratory. WordPress opens a new market for shops which do not need a complex CMS setup. The last big task is at the moment only the router, which must be adjusted to the WordPress links. The ACL is at the moment only roughly translated, but it will be possible to make it more fine grained later, so that we can simulate 80% of the Joomla rights within Wordpress. Transforming VirtueMart to a cms-less system forces us to use an own user table. So in future we will have real Virtuemart users, not being based on the old Joomla table. The basic trick is that we still use a light version of the Joomla libraries, so extension developers can easily write extensions compatible to Joomla and WordPress. We hope that we can extend this technique to integrate VM into more CMS systems like Drupal. We plan to publish a beta before Christmas.</p>
<p>Since it is the last of its series, we added some of the<a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail" target="_blank"> membership features</a> to the main version. So product variants work now also in the category browse view. Changing the ordering within a dropdown of a multivariant was quite painful. But we added a drag and drop for the children list, so it is very easy to adjust.</p>
<p>Here an incomplete list of the new features</p>
<h3>New Features for shopowners</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customfields of type S (String) and P (Property) can be used to automatically create a dropdown for search (like tags)</li>
<li>Added ajax for child variants in category browse view - MV (MultiVariant) and GC (GenericVariant)</li>
<li>Category view now has the same options for displaying additional VM content as were available in the virtuemart view (which is now deprecated)</li>
<li>Update of com_tcpdf to tcpdf version 6.2.12</li>
<li>Added drag and drop sorting of MultiVariants in product edit</li>
<li>Already loaded grouped products are not displayed twice on the same browse view</li>
<li>Product is now virtually added to the cart before the conditions are tested. So it works now also for weights and other conditions (not just price)</li>
<li>User dependent currency for invoice, mail, and order view</li>
<li>Currency can now use the "space character" in the display format</li>
<li>Payment and shipment methods can now be edited in different currencies</li>
<li>Changed addProductToRecent so that it always stores 10 product ids; can be adjust by hidden config max_recent_products</li>
<li>Added a template vmbeez3 derived from beez3</li>
<li>New VirtueMart/Joomla! 3 full installer</li>
<li>Paypal accepts multiple currencies</li>
<li>Amazon works now with the cart ajax and updated library</li>
<li>Avatax taxfreightcode added</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features for developer and templater</h3>
<ul>
<li>shopfunctions::getLoginForm works now with a sublayout login, so it can be used in other views</li>
<li>Added trigger plgVmOnCheckoutCheckStock</li>
<li>Removed id tag from dropdowns to ensure that chosen can always generate a unique id</li>
<li>Quite a lot of JS enhancements, more robust and faster</li>
<li>Added function sendCurrForm, which simply fires the form if an input has the right class.</li>
<li>Plugins can now define in the constructor which values should be handled as convertables</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Important for shops with overrides</span></h2>
<p>The new js for using ajax for reloading product content uses now always the same class. The class is "product-container". Just search for the div with "productdetails-view productdetails" and add "product-container". In case you want the ajax reload within a product modul, you need to adjust the overrides here also. Furthermore the layout login of the user view is now in the sublayout folder. Members who used the ajax for child variants within the browse view should change the layout back to default.</p>
<p>For a full list of all changes or more information how to adjust your overrides, please read here in our forum <a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0">http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0&nbsp;</a><a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0"></a></p>

<p>Vm3.0.14 is a clean update for any older vm version. We fixed some bugs and added&nbsp;some new features paid by the membership system&nbsp;<a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a><br />Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change order status of multiple selected orders in the order list using one simple click</li>
<li>Create links without Category Name and/or without product suffix</li>
<li>product parent id editing field in product edit, so products can be attached to patterns</li>
<li>Product multivariants&nbsp;can use a radiolist instead of dropdowns</li>
<li>PHP7 compatibilty</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very mature release. The maintrunk is already working with the new VMF system which should help to write a bridge for Wordpress. The vm3.1 version is for developers and eager early adopters. For the moment it is the goal, that the whole core works with the new abstraction layer, to concentrate and bundle the bridgeable code.</p>
<p>You should always take&nbsp;a backup of your database. The tableupdater has been&nbsp;strongly enhanced and should handle tables with broken or missing primary fields (fields with auto_increment) a lot better.&nbsp;Note that whilst this has been tested on numerous deployments of VM it is still relatively new.</p>

<p>The critical security leak was already used in the wild. This means it is not a leak, which was disovered by an audit, it is security issue which is already exploited. Sucuri.net blogged about&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/12/remote-command-execution-vulnerability-in-joomla.html">https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/12/remote-command-execution-vulnerability-in-joomla.html</a></p>
<h4>Protect Your Site Now</h4>
<p>If you are a Joomla user, check your logs right away. Look for requests from&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 900; line-height: 1.3;">146.0.72.83</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 900; line-height: 1.3;">74.3.170.33</span>or&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 900; line-height: 1.3;">194.28.174.106</span>&nbsp;as they were the first IP addresses to start the exploitation. I also recommend searching your logs for “<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 900; line-height: 1.3;">JDatabaseDriverMysqli</span>” or “<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 900; line-height: 1.3;">O:</span>” in the User Agent as it has been used in the exploits. If you find them, consider your Joomla site compromised and move to the remediation / incident response phase.</p>
<p>For securing your joomla 1.5/2.5 pages, just follow this link&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions">https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions</a>. It is basically replacing one file.</p>

<p>We are proud to offer the direct link between online and offline sales with VirtueMart &amp; POS for Webshops.</p>
<p>Now there is a complete Point of Sale (POS) available for VirtueMart. When you have a physical store and a VirtueMart webshop you can sell goods with your Point of Sale without giving your sales staff access to the VirtueMart backend. All products / orders / calculation rules / customers will be synchronized into the POS.</p>
<p>The sales staff can check the VirtueMart weborders from the POS and take the goods from the store with the OrderPicker. After an order is picked it will change the order status in Virtuemart automatically into a pre-defined status like “Ready for Shipment”. When new goods arrive from the supplier you can add those to the (VirtueMart) stock just by scanning the product barcode in the Stockmanager.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Key Features</strong></p>
<ul class="check">
<li>Direct sync with VirtueMart</li>
<li>Easy interface</li>
<li>Different logins</li>
<li>Use VM calculation rules and Shopper Groups</li>
<li>Add customer to an order</li>
<li>Use barcodes to add products to an order.</li>
<li>Customize the sync options with the Payment methods in the POS.</li>
<li>You can print receipts as well as invoices.</li>
<li>Orderpicker and Stockmanger included.</li>
<li>And much more…</li>

<p>The company Qualys.com found a new issue, a possible XSS. It misuses the array keys in the URL. Most servers prevent such an URL by default, but nevertheless we've added another protection. We also found and fixed some smaller bugs and glitches in advanced functions and last but not least we added missing backward compatibility for some cases. This release follows 3 release candidates with more than 2000 downloads altogether.</p>
<h3>New Goal</h3>
<p>Sticking to the Joomla API has emerged as an unlucky decision for us. The future plan is to write more for our own framework VMF, which will give us the freedom to also use other systems than Joomla. The idea is to write a small framework, so that extensions written for VirtueMart should also work on different platforms than Joomla. In other words, instead of developing a standalone VirtueMart, we will try to write an easily bridgeable VirtueMart. We already saw a VirtueMart running on Drupal, so it can't be too hard. But first we want to look into Wordpress. Of course we will need test users and suggestions from developers who are familiar with Wordpress and VirtueMart. So please join our forum if you have some experience with these. We also think about using the Joomla platform by the team of Johan Janssens&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform">https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform</a> for our next full installer.</p>
<h3>New Docs</h3>
<p>Due to our membership system <a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a> we did find some time to update our manual. We added a lot of pages, which explain general VirtueMart concepts at <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html</a> - It's worthwhile to read them. Even VirtueMart veterans already found some new tricks in it!</p>

</ul>
<p>The full bug fix list is available here this time: <a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=131898.0">http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=131898.0</a><a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=131898.0"></a></p>
<p>We also updated VirtueMart 2.6. The new version got the security fixes, enhanced payment plugins and uses now mainly the vm3 table layout. It increases noticeable the performance</p>

<p>The last stable version vm3.0.8 was 5 months ago. Development has continued during this time, we just spent additional time testing and checking to deliver a more stable version.</p>
<p>We added the ajax script to the cart, so that the new cart is almost like an OPC, you will still add/edit addresses in a separate page. It is backward compatible as long any 3rd party developer/templater uses our javascript handler <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html</a></p>
